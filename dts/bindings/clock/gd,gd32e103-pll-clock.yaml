  Main PLL node binding for Connectivity line devices (STM32F105/STM32F107)

  Takes one of clk_hse, pll2 or clk_hsi as input clock.
  When clk_hsi is used a fixed prescaler is applied. When input clock is hse or
  pll2, configurable prescaler is used.

  Up to 2 output clocks could be supported and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formula:

    f(PLLCLK) = f(PLLIN) x PLLMUL       --> SYSCLK (System Clock)
    f(USBCLK) = f(PLLCLK) * 2 / USBPRE  --> USB

    with, depending on the case:
            f(PLLIN) = f(input_clk) / 2       if input_clk = clk_hsi
            f(PLLIN) = f(input_clk) / PREDIV  if input_clk = clk_hse or pll2

  The PLL output frequency must not exceed 72 MHz.
